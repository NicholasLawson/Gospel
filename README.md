This is the core file of the Gospel of the Return of the Armada of Youth

What happens when a robust complete novel is added to the GitHub Community, how would you expand on this book
noting that this is the first time that this is the first novel that has ever had a chance to be developed
into what could be depending on interest an actual fictional never ending story that could essentially if enough 
time and care was taken ... from the forks and branches of this story ... an entire universe could be created ...
with possible movie contracts to come ... television deals ... how do you feel about building a universe starting
with a city that has a 300 foot tall computer?

I know you can code, that is not at question, I want to know if you can write.
